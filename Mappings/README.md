# Mappings
Buyer beware! The Windows-based license mappings are almost pure guesswork, as are some of the more esoteric SUSE and RedHat
for SAP license mappings. This is true for both the license tags pulled from the API, as well as the SKUs they map to.
Pull requests are welcome from those who encounter faulty mappings.
